This directory contains few simple examples to demonstrate how Lite templates are meant to look like.

Examples with .txt suffix are small examples to test more or less parsing. simple-elisp-project-readme.org is a small readme file starter/generator to illustrate how Lite template might be used in a README file generator.

For the README example, the project-name variable has to be defined elsewhere in your code. For example:

(defvar project-name "Your project")
